        Since 2015, I have called Lisbon home, having arrived to pursue my college
        education. This vibrant city has not only been the backdrop for my
        academic and professional growth but has also enriched my cultural
        experiences. While my academic background focused on multimedia and
        audiovisual subjects, I’ve shifted toward a more technical path. Over
        three years, my journey has been transformative, expanding my
        understanding of technology and guiding me toward complex technical
        troubleshooting. I am now enthusiastically committed to continuous
        learning and skill development, eager to deepen my understanding of coding
        and technology.
